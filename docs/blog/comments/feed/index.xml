					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/photographer-journey-beginner-pro-rules-tips/#comment-92&quot;&gt;Michel&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Michael,

thank you for your comments. Can you be more specific and tell me where I go wrong? If you refer to the section about the aperture/shutter speed/ISO triangle, when I say to take exposure into account I mean exposure as in the amount of light present in the scene, so what a light meter would indicate if you take a reading.
You can&#039;t rely only on the meter of the camera as that will always try to expose to a neutral gray. 
For ex. shooting in a dark alley, shooting a landscape with snow or shooting against the sun will require exposure compensation, and that&#039;s a manual setting that the photographer will make taking into account exposure. That&#039;s what I meant.

Regarding RAW files, as with all things there are opinions and opinions: search for Jared Polin&#039;s and Tony Northrup&#039;s recent online debate on YouTube and see arguments both ways.

Most of the times you would deliver the processed photo to a client, but there are cases where the client might want the RAW file too (especially if they are magazines and they have their own graphical designers team).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Most of it is just the basics, but when you go more in-depth, you&#039;re quite wrong..

Exposure is the combination of Aperture vs Shutter Speed. Those two variables are the most important in determining the exposure. Exposure is nothing more than the amount of light let in. Now the longer the shutter stays open, the more exposed. The wider the aperture, the more exposed.

Also when you talk about RAW.. real Pro&#039;s will always use RAW for their shoots, and the disadvantage you mention of RAW requiring processing, is actually the greatest advantage of RAW. You get so much more out of a RAW photo. As a beginner, I switched to RAW from Jpeg the moment I started using the a/s/m modes on my Nikon, so basically my whole photographic career. I&#039;ve never regretted it, and I have never felt that a photo would have been better if it was shot in JPEG.

Also, because RAW requires processing, no pro will deliver that image format to their clients. Its like hiring a painter to paint your house, and the painter then handing you the brush and paint and saying he&#039;s all finished up.]]></description>
