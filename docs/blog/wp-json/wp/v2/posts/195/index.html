DSLR cameras offer a multitude of settings that can be intimidating if you are a beginner photographer.<\/p>\n<p>I hear this a lot:<\/p>\n<p>Professional photographers always shoot in full manual mode. Trust me: that is simply not true&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;but pro photographers can shoot in full manual mode because they understand how all the settings of the camera influence the resulting photo.<\/p>\n<p>You know this already:<\/p>\n<p>Photography is all about light. Capture the right amount of light and your exposures will be correct.<\/p>\n<p>But lighting conditions are not always ideal. That is why you have to learn how to set your DSLR camera to compensate for the lack or excess of light.<\/p>\n<p>Capture too much light and your photo will be overexposed. Too little light and you get an underexposed image.<\/p>\n<p>Know this:<\/p>\n<p>A technically correct photo is not automatically a beautiful photo. But, it&#8217;s almost always a requirement for any good photo.<\/p>\n<p>This post is <strong>strictly about the technical side of taking pictures using a DSLR<\/strong>. So, if you are ready for the 3 secrets that will improve the quality of the pictures you take&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;let&#8217;s begin!<\/p>\n<h2>1. ISO Explained<\/h2>\n<p>The simple explanation:<\/p>\n<p>The ISO setting determines the sensitivity to light of your camera&#8217;s sensor. With numbers ranging from 100 up, a higher ISO setting means the sensor is more sensitive to light.<\/p>\n<p>What does that mean?<\/p>\n<p>It means that a higher ISO setting will allow taking pictures in lower lighting conditions. Higher ISO will brighten the image.<\/p>\n<p>But, there&#8217;s a trade off:<\/p>\n<p>Because the camera will be more sensitive, higher ISO settings will also increase the granular noise in the picture.<\/p>\n<h3>Practical ISO Examples<\/h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s see some examples of photos taken with different ISO settings.<\/p>\n<p>I took two pictures in full manual mode. First one is at ISO 100. As you can see the exposure is incorrect and I got an underexposed shot (the image is too dark).<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-216 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/www.textures4photoshop.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/iso-example-same-settings-1024x513.jpg\" alt=\"iso example 100 vs 800 same settings\" width=\"1024\" height=\"513\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.textures4photoshop.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/iso-example-same-settings.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.textures4photoshop.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/iso-example-same-settings-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.textures4photoshop.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/iso-example-same-settings-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>By increasing the ISO setting to 800, leaving the other settings the same and keeping the same lighting conditions, I was able to get the correct exposure on the right.<\/p>\n<p>That looks better!<\/p>\n<p>So, by setting a higher ISO I managed to get the correct exposure. If you look at the detail on the bottom, there is some noticeable noise. However, sometimes you have to make a compromise and accept at least some noise in the picture if that allows you to get the right exposure.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s now see what happens if you abuse the ISO setting and you set it too high. For this I setup another example.<\/p>\n<p>I shot two other photos. One at ISO 100 and one at ISO 1600.<\/p>\n<p>This time I set the camera on a semi-automatic mode called <strong>P (Program Mode)<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-219\" src=\"http:\/\/www.textures4photoshop.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/iso-example-program-mode-100-vs-1600-1024x513.jpg\" alt=\"iso example program mode 100 vs 1600\" width=\"1024\" height=\"513\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.textures4photoshop.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/iso-example-program-mode-100-vs-1600.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/www.textures4photoshop.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/iso-example-program-mode-100-vs-1600-300x150.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.textures4photoshop.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/iso-example-program-mode-100-vs-1600-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In this mode the DSLR camera will try to calculate the right exposure. I only changed the ISO and let the camera decide on the other settings. At ISO 1600 we are starting to see a lot of noise.<\/p>\n<p>The ISO setting is probably the easiest setting on your DSLR camera to understand.<\/p>\n<h3>Keep this in mind:<\/h3>\n<p>In practice you will probably want to start by setting ISO 100 regardless of the camera mode settings. This will give you minimal noise.<\/p>\n<p>If the photo is underexposed or blurry, then keep all the other settings the same, increase the ISO and take another shot. Do this again until you get the right exposure.<\/p>\n<p>[section cssclass=&#8221;blue accent&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h3>SECRET #1<\/h3>\n<h2>How to Remove ISO Noise Using Photoshop<\/h2>\n<p>For removing ISO noise you will need to take several shots of the subject.<\/p>\n<p>Then open these shots in Photoshop using\u00a0<strong>File &gt; Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack&#8230;<\/strong>\u00a0checking the\u00a0<strong>Create Smart Object after Loading Layers\u00a0<\/strong>checkbox<\/p>\n<p>This will create a smart object with the shots stacked inside it. With this smart object selected go to\u00a0<strong>Layer &gt; Smart Objects &gt; Stack Mode &gt; Mean<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Using this technique you will highly reduce or even remove most of the ISO noise grain.<\/p>\n<p>The more shots of the subject you stack, the better the result.<\/p>\n<p>[\/section]<\/p>\n<p>When the noise is still too obvious then you&#8217;ll probably need to use one of the other photography secrets in this post.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s see what&#8217;s next.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Shutter Speed Explained<\/h2>\n<p>To take a picture, DSLR cameras quickly open and close a &#8220;small door&#8221; to let light reach the sensor. The &#8220;small door&#8221; is called shutter.<\/p>\n<p>Shutter speed determines how fast the shutter is opened and closed.<\/p>\n<p>More specifically:<\/p>\n<p>The shutter speed measures the amount of time that the camera sensor is exposed to light for taking a picture. The longer the time, the more light gets to the sensor and the image will be brighter.<\/p>\n<p>Also important:<\/p>\n<p>If your subject is moving you might get a blurry picture. Setting a faster shutter speed will allow you to get a sharper photo.<\/p>\n<p>[section cssclass=&#8221;orange accent&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h3>SECRET #2<\/h3>\n<h2>Avoid Camera Shake Using A Simple Rule<\/h2>\n<p>If you are not using a tripod you have to hold the camera very still when taking a shot. But even then, if the shutter speed is not fast enough you might get a blurry picture.<\/p>\n<p>How fast is fast enough for the shutter speed?<\/p>\n<p><strong>I always use this rule:<\/strong> set the shutter speed to approximately 1\/x sec where x is equal to the focal length.<\/p>\n<p>For example: if I&#8217;m shooting at 50mm, a 1\/50 sec or faster will be enough for avoiding the camera shake. At 300mm you need to go even faster at 1\/300mm and so on.<\/p>\n<p>[\/section]<\/p>\n<h3>Let&#8217;s see a few examples of using the shutter speed<\/h3>\n<p>I took two photos of a spinning coin:<\/p>\n<p>One with 1\/5 seconds shutter speed and one with 1\/100 seconds. Here&#8217;s the difference.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-240\" src=\"http:\/\/www.textures4photoshop.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/shutter-speed-example.jpg\" alt=\"shutter speed spinning coin example\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.textures4photoshop.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/shutter-speed-example.jpg 1000w, http:\/\/www.textures4photoshop.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/shutter-speed-example-300x201.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.textures4photoshop.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/shutter-speed-example-768x514.jpg 768w, http:\/\/www.textures4photoshop.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/shutter-speed-example-272x182.jpg 272w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s all about the balance<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You have to set a shutter speed fast enough to avoid blurry photos, but slow enough to get enough light to the sensor.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Remember Secret #1 &#8211; ISO<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The DSLR camera settings are meant to be used together.<\/p>\n<p>What if the shutter speed that gives you a good exposure is not fast enough to freeze the subject and it still looks blurry?<\/p>\n<p>The solution is:<\/p>\n<p>Increase the ISO. This will allow you to set faster shutter speeds and getting the same exposure levels. That is what I did in the example above to get the same level of exposure.<\/p>\n<p>To sum up:<\/p>\n<p>You can brighten an exposure using a slower shutter speed. And you can darken an exposure by setting a faster shutter speed. Also, you can eliminate blurry moving subjects with faster shutter speeds and increase the ISO to keep the correct exposure.<\/p>\n<p>All DSLR camera have a setting mode which allow you to set the shutter speed directly. For some cameras it&#8217;s marked as <strong>S (Shutter Priority)<\/strong> and on other cameras it&#8217;s marked as <strong>Tv (Time Value)<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_243\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-243\" style=\"width: 452px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-243 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/www.textures4photoshop.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/dslr-cameras-mode-wheel.jpg\" alt=\"dslr cameras mode wheel\" width=\"452\" height=\"494\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.textures4photoshop.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/dslr-cameras-mode-wheel.jpg 452w, http:\/\/www.textures4photoshop.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/dslr-cameras-mode-wheel-274x300.jpg 274w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-243\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mode Selection Wheel of Various DSLR Cameras<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Now that we understand two key concepts of photography, we are moving from full auto to semi-automatic mode.<\/p>\n<p>Just one more step to mastering full manual mode.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Aperture Explained<\/h2>\n<p>Aperture measures how wide the lens is opening when the shutter is opened. A wider opening lets more light in.<\/p>\n<p>Quick remark:<\/p>\n<p>The aperture setting is given as a so called &#8220;f-number&#8221;. Not to be confused with the &#8220;f-word&#8221; \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p>All you need to know is:<\/p>\n<p>The value of the aperture is an inversely proportional number to the area of the lens opening. For example, an F\/2 setting means an opening larger than an F\/4.<\/p>\n<p>Confused? Don&#8217;t be!<\/p>\n<p>The math and optics formulas behind this is not important. What is important is to understand how the aperture setting influences your photos.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the deal:<\/p>\n<p>A higher F-number (narrow aperture) means that the camera sensor receives less light. A lower F-number (wide aperture) lets more light reach the sensor.<\/p>\n<p>So, if your photo is underexposed, you can set a lower F-number to get more light in.<\/p>\n<p>But how low can the F-number be?<\/p>\n<p>That depends on the lens you use. The lowest F-number available for a lens is part of the name of the lens.<\/p>\n<p>For example: the <strong>AF-S Nikkor 35mm 1.8 lens<\/strong> I&#8217;ve used for the photos in this post has a minimum F-number equal to F\/1.8.<\/p>\n<p>So, setting the aperture to F\/1.8 will give me the maximum opening of this lens and therefore the maximum amount of light this lens can let into the camera.<\/p>\n<p>Again, there&#8217;s a catch:<\/p>\n<p>Using wider aperture there is a trade off that you must be aware of. The wider the aperture, the narrower the\u00a0<strong>depth of field<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h3>Wait a moment, depth of what?<\/h3>\n<p>The depth of field or DOF is the effective focus range, or the area that will be in focus. When you take a photo and focus on a subject, imagine two planes parallel to the sensor: one in front and one behind the subject in focus. That is the depth of field.<\/p>\n<p>The two planes can be closer or further from each other meaning a narrower or wider depth of field.<\/p>\n<p>The best way to explain aperture and DOF is through an example.<\/p>\n<p>I took these three photos with three different aperture settings:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-255\" src=\"http:\/\/www.textures4photoshop.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/aperture-example.jpg\" alt=\"aperture example\" width=\"1000\" height=\"227\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.textures4photoshop.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/aperture-example.jpg 1000w, http:\/\/www.textures4photoshop.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/aperture-example-300x68.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.textures4photoshop.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/aperture-example-768x174.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As you can see, the DOF is wider and wider as the F-number is higher. That is: more of the subject is in focus. Also, as the F-number goes up (the aperture is smaller), I need more light to compensate for the less light going to the sensor.<\/p>\n<p>To do this I had to use a slower shutter speed going from 1\/10 second to 1 and then 3 seconds.<\/p>\n<p>[section cssclass=&#8221;magenta accent&#8221;]<\/p>\n<h3>SECRET #3<\/h3>\n<h2>Aperture and Bokeh Go Together<\/h2>\n<p>Foreground and background are both important.<\/p>\n<p>Combine a sharp subject in the foreground with a soft background and you get a beautiful photo.<\/p>\n<p>The soft background is often called bokeh. Higher F-numbers will give you less of the bokeh effect.<\/p>\n<p>Also, different lenses give different looking bokeh effects. The main factor in this is the number of blades that the lens has. You can check for this in your lens&#8217; specifications.<\/p>\n<p>The more blades the aperture has the rounder the highlights in the bokeh. The less blades, the highlights will tend to be more square shaped.<\/p>\n<p>[\/section]<\/p>\n<h2>Congratulations<\/h2>\n<p>You can now switch your DSLR camera to full manual mode. You now understand how to joggle the three powerful settings of your camera to get the correct exposure.<\/p>\n<p>Mastering the manual mode allows you to control the exposure, but my advice is to only use full manual mode if all other semi-automatic modes fail to give you the result you want.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll let you in on a secret:<\/p>\n<p>For most of the images I shot for our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.textures4photoshop.com\/tex\/\">free texture directory in textures4photoshop.com<\/a> I used the semi-automatic P (Program Mode) and A (Aperture Priority Mode).<\/p>\n<p>Why?<\/p>\n<p>Because DSLR cameras today are very good in calculating the required settings for a correct exposure. I used the Aperture Priority mode for a lot of photos as I wanted to set the aperture at F\/3.5, which gives me the sharpest results for my lens according to the specs.<\/p>\n<p>Hope you enjoyed this post.
